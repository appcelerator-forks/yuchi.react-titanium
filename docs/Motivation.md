# Motivation

It is a known fact that front-end development has been pushing the boundaries of what is to be considered the best-practice.

In fact completely opposites views on central topics emerged, and for each there’s at least a reference implementation.

Let’s make it clear: there’s no clear winner here. And this is perfectly ok. Rarely choice is an issue.

As a front-end developer myself, and a [Titanium™ SDK][ti] user more specifically, I want to have that freedom-of-choice that is fostering innovation in the web also when I’m developing cross-platform native apps.

**Fact is, I have it already!**

This project, *react-titanium*, was born exactly to **prove that**. And also because I’m not too fond of [Alloy][alloy], but please do not spread the word too much on this ;)

## Why React <small>(and not Angular?)</small>

React is a perfect candidate to show the power of Titanium™ SDK APIs, mostly because it is **not a web framework**, but more a **general approach UI framework**.

Angular and Ember, for instance, are very web-oriented and therefore would pose too many issues on porting them to Titanium™.

React would also let me escape the MVC pattern, which is not *necessarily* the right choice.

Anyway you can have two-way data bindings in Alloy using [David Bankier][dbankier]’s [`nano`][nano].

## Ok, I like it

Awesome! What about giving it a try and [install it](Installation.md)?
