# Motivation

It is a known fact that front-end development has been pushing the boundaries of what is to be considered the best-practice.

In fact completely opposites views on central topics emerged, and for each there’s at least a reference implementation.

Let’s make it clear: there’s no clear winner here. And this is perfectly ok. Rarely choice is an issue.

As a front-end developer myself, and a Titanium™ SDK user more specifically, I want to have that freedom-of-choice that is fostering innovation in the web.

**Fact is, I have it already!**

This project, *react-titanium*, was born exactly to **prove that**. And also because I’m not too fond of Alloy, but please do not spread the word too much.
